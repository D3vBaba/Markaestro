## Phase 1 (in progress)

- Automations page scaffold
- Analytics page scaffold
- Settings page scaffold

## Phase 2

- Campaign CRUD + channel assignments
- Content calendar and scheduler queue

## Phase 3
- Integrations: X, TikTok, Resend
- Event-driven automations
- Recommendations engine (what to post next)

## Immediate next steps
